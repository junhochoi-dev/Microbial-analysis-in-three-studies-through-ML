Study Name

Infant nasopharyngeal bacteria microbiome

Classification

Host-associated > Human > Respiratory system > Nasopharyngeal

Description

Bacterial community profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates across a birth cohort of 234 infants. Multiple samples per child, including "healthy" NP samples collected in the absence of respiratory symptoms and "infection" NP samples collected during episodes of acute respiratory illness.

Study Name

Association of host genome with intestinal microbial composition in a large healthy cohort

Classification

Host-associated > Human > Digestive system > Large intestine > Fecal

Description

Intestinal microbiota is known to be important in health and disease. Its composition is influenced by both environmental and host factors. However, few large-scale studies have evaluated the association between host genetic variation and the composition of microbiota. We recruited a cohort of 1,561 healthy individuals, of whom 270 belong in 123 families, and found that almost one-third of fecal bacterial taxa were heritable. In addition, we identified 58 SNPs associated with the relative abundance of 33 taxa in 1 ,098 discovery subjects. Among these, four loci were replicated in a second cohort of 463 subjects: rs621711 78 (nearest gene UBR3) associated with Rikenellaceae, rs1394174 (CNTN6) associated with Faecalibacterium, rs59846192 (DMRTB1) associated with Lachnospira, and rs28473221 (SALL3) associated with Eubacterium. After correction for multiple testing, six associations of 58 remained significant, one of which replicated. These results identify associations between specific genetic variants and the gut microbiome.

Study Name

the upper respiratory tract microbiome of chronic rhinosinusitis patients

Classification

Host-associated > Human > Respiratory system > Nasopharyngeal

Description

Swab samples were taken from the anterior nares (nose), nasopharynx, maxillary sinus and ethmoid sinus of 200 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Bacterial DNA was extracted, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq machine. Samples were sequenced on five different runs.
